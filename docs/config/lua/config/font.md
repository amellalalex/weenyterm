# `font`

Configures the font to use by default.  The `font` setting can specify
a set of fallbacks and other options, and is described in more detail
in the [Fonts](../../fonts.md) section.

You will typically use [weenyterm.font](../weenyterm/font.md) or
[weenyterm.font_with_fallback](../weenyterm/font_with_fallback.md) to specify the
font.
