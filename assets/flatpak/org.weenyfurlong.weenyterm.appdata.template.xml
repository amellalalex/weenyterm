  <summary>Powerful terminal and multiplexer</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      WeenyTerm is a terminal emulator with support for modern features such as
      fonts with ligatures, hyperlinks, multiple windows, tabs and split panes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Configuration is expressed using Lua and many powerful functions are
      provided to help you customize your terminal to your workflow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Integrated ssh allows using multiple tabs and panes without requiring
      tmux to be installed on the remote host, and remote weenyterm multiplexer
      support allows tmux+mosh style workflows without using tmux or mosh,
      while providing a fully native GUI locally.
    </p>
